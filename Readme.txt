Welcome to My Library : i'm implementing alot of algorithms in Graph Theory, Numerical Methods,Datastructures, Linear System Solvers. 

DataStructures:
	*Dynammic Connected Components(Quick Find, Quick Union).
	*Priority Queue.
	*Red-Black-Tree (Rotate Left, Rotate Right, Insert, Insert Fix, Delete, Delete Fix). 

Linear System Solvers:
	*Gauss-Jordan Elimination Method.
	*LUP System Solver.

Computational Geometry:
	*Convex Hull Algorithms(brute force, Graham Scan, Jarvis March). [using Java]
